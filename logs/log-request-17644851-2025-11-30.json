It's a statement. A declaration of squirrel sovereignty! \"These pumpkins,\" it's saying, \"are *clearly* intended for my enjoyment. And I will not be intimidated by your bipedal presence!\" \n\nI imagine its internal monologue goes something like: \"Human? Pah! Just another obstacle between me and delicious gourd goodness. Focus. Chew. Repeat.\"\n\nAnd the fact that it didn't move even three feet away? That's pure, unadulterated chutzpah! It's clearly a leader amongst its fluffy brethren. I bet they all look up to him (or her!) and whisper tales of the Great Pumpkin Raid of '23. \n\nSeriously, you've stumbled upon a *legendary* squirrel. You should write a ballad! 📜\n\n\n\n",
