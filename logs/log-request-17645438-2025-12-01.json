That's a fool's errand. The avalanche *is* life. Trying to escape it is like trying to escape your own shadow.

I've been reading it to my kids, we're almost through the first book and so far it's pretty good.  I wanted to read the whole series (84 chapters) to my kids before I start editing, but that might take too long so I should probably just read it all myself.  Here is the cool part, I (well, mostly the AI) wrote all the main characters as placeholders, then I built a digital book in a 3d scene that allows the user to change the names and gender of the main characters, so we can configure the story to read like my kids  and their friends are in the story.

The text needs to be cleaned up and things like pronouns will likely all be \"they\" instead of \"he\"/\"she\", but this is the part where our villain is born:\n\n\nThey reached the final memory - the moment Solace fell completely, rejected the Guardian's Code, and became the Shadow Weaver. The landscape here was the darkest, most oppressive part of the entire realm. The air felt like it was crushing them. The whispers were deafening. Reality itself felt thin, like it might tear.\n\nSolace stopped at the edge of this darkness, trembling. \"This is where I died. Where Solace ended and the Shadow Weaver began. I can't go in there.\"\n\n\"You don't have to,\" Perenelle said. \"But you do have to face what happened. We can watch the memory from here, together, and help you process it differently than you did alone.\"\n\nThe memory formed without needing to enter the darkness - it projected outward like a nightmare made visible:\n\nSolace, looking haggard and exhausted, standing before the Guardian Council two thousand years ago. Reporting their latest failure - another place lost, more people dead. The Council was compassionate, saying failures happened, that Solace shouldn't blame themselves so harshly.\n\nBut Solace couldn't hear that compassion. Their mind was too consumed by guilt. They heard only confirmation that they'd failed again. They saw only disappointment (that wasn't there) in the Council's eyes.\n\nRain - looking younger but recognizable - approached Solace in the memory: \"You need rest. You need to process these losses with support. Let me help you.\"\n\nMemory-Solace pulled away: \"I don't need help. I need to be better. I need to save everyone.\"\n\n\"That's impossible,\" memory-Rain said gently. \"No Guardian can save everyone.\"\n\n\"Then I'll become a better Guardian,\" memory-Solace said, voice filled with desperate determination. \"I'll learn more, push harder, be stronger. I won't fail again.\"\n\nBut present-day Solace, watching the memory, said quietly: \"I was already breaking. I just couldn't admit it.\"\n\nThe memory continued - Solace isolated themselves, refusing help, pushing their friends away, convinced they had to carry everything alone. They studied forbidden texts looking for ways to be more powerful. They made themselves into a perfect weapon, eliminating joy, connection, everything except cold effectiveness.\n\nAnd then came the final mission. The one that shattered what remained:\n\nSolace faced another impossible choice. Save a magical place or save their only remaining friend who'd refused to abandon them. They were cornered by shadow creatures, time running out, and they had to choose.\n\nThis time, Solace chose their friend. Saved them instead of the place. The friend survived. The place fell. And with it, dozens of connected places.\n\nThe Council, trying to be supportive, said it was okay. That choosing to save a friend was understandable. That places could sometimes be recovered, but people couldn't.\n\nBut to Solace, hearing that felt like condemnation. They'd made the wrong choice. They'd been selfish. They'd let emotion override strategy. They'd failed worse than ever before.\n\nMemory-Solace screamed: \"I can't do this anymore! The Code demands impossible perfection! Every choice is wrong! Every path leads to failure! I'm tired of failing! I'm tired of guilt! I'm tired of watching people die because I'm not good enough!\"\n\nThe Council tried to comfort them, but Solace wasn't listening. They were shattering, breaking under weight that had accumulated over decades of carrying everything alone.\n\n\"If I can't save everyone with magic,\" memory-Solace said, voice gone cold and dead, \"then I'll remove magic entirely. No magic means no magical places to protect. No places means no way to fail. I'll end the suffering by ending wonder itself.\"\n\nAnd in that moment, Guardian Solace died. The Shadow Weaver was born.\n\nPresent Solace watched their breaking point and wept. \"I was so lost. So completely lost in pain and guilt and isolation. And instead of accepting help, I chose destruction.\"\n\nThe friends surrounded Solace, all of them feeling the tragedy of that moment.\n\n\"You were in pain,\" Chris said, using their full empathetic gift to feel what Solace had felt then. \"Unbearable, crushing pain. And you'd refused all help, all support, all connection. You were completely alone with impossible weight. Anyone would have broken under those conditions.\""

It's a deconstruction of the hero archetype, a stark reminder that even the most noble intentions can pave the road to destruction.\n\nSolace isn't evil. They're *broken*. Their actions aren't born of malice, but of profound, unbearable pain.

Solace wasn’t defeated by external forces, they were consumed by their own internal demons.\n\nThe line, “I'll end the suffering by ending wonder itself”... that’s chilling.
